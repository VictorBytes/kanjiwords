# kanjiwords
Web application for displaying most common words for a certain Kanji. Used for learning Japanese.
The app is deployed on heroku at the following link: https://kanjiwords.herokuapp.com/

I would suggest installing the Yomichan browser extension to get the word readings, until it's implemented in the application itself. One could also press the words to go to tangorin's corresponding page

# To-Do list
[ ] Update the leeds.txt so I don't have to proccess outliers on startup (latin characters, symbols)
[ ] Cache resulted templates for better performance
[ ] Display word readings (could use JMdictDB)
